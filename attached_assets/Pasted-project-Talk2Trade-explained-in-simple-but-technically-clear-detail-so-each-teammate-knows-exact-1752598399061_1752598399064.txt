🧩 Full Feature Breakdown for Talk2Trade
An AI-powered voice and text-based catalog assistant built for farmers, artisans, and kirana store owners to create, translate, and manage product listings easily with zero tech knowledge.

🔹 1. Voice Input in Local Language
🎤 “Speak your product details – Talk2Trade will handle the rest.”
What it does:
•	Allows user to speak in regional languages (like Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, etc.) instead of typing.
•	Uses AI speech-to-text engine (e.g., Whisper) to convert that into accurate text.
Example:
User speaks: “இது நாட்டுச் செவ்வியல் நெய், 500 மில்லி”
System converts to: “This is 500ml organic desi ghee”
Why it’s useful:
Many sellers are not comfortable typing or don’t know English. This makes the tool inclusive and usable with just their voice.

🔹 2. Text Input (Optional for Skilled Users)
⌨️ “Also supports manual text entry for those who prefer it.”
What it does:
•	User can type in local language or English directly.
•	Supports Unicode input for Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, etc.
Why it’s useful:
Some shopkeepers' kids or younger people may want to enter things by typing. We offer both options.

🔹 3. Local Language to English Translation
🌐 “Automatically converts local language to business-ready English.”
What it does:
•	After getting input (spoken or typed), the system translates it to market-ready English using GPT or Translate API.
•	Handles code-mixed input (like “இது 1kg ராகி புடி”).
Example:
Input: “1 கிலோ ராகி புடி, நெய், கண்ணாடி பாட்டிலில்”
Translated: “1 kg Ragi Flour and Ghee in a glass bottle”
Why it’s useful:
Online marketplaces and digital catalogs need standard English. This ensures listings are understood by broader customers.

🔹 4. AI-Powered Product Description Generator
✍️ “From simple input to beautiful catalog-ready descriptions.”
What it does:
•	Converts minimal info (name + quantity + material) into full title, short description, and SEO description.
•	Output looks professional and attractive.
Example:
Input: "Handmade soap, neem oil, 100g"
Generated:
•	Title: “Handmade Neem Oil Soap – 100g”
•	Short: “Natural herbal soap, free of chemicals, made from neem oil.”
•	SEO: “Pure neem oil soap ideal for skincare. 100g handmade herbal bar, chemical-free and eco-friendly.”
Why it’s useful:
Small sellers can’t write marketing content. This makes their listing look professional and competitive.

🔹 5. Automatic Product Category Mapping
🧭 “Classifies product into correct category automatically.”
What it does:
•	Maps the product to a suitable e-commerce category like:
o	Groceries > Oils > Ghee
o	Handicrafts > Baskets > Bamboo
•	Ensures the product fits online catalog requirements (like Amazon, ONDC, etc.)
Why it’s useful:
Sellers often don’t know what category to choose. This keeps things organized and ready for integration into platforms.

📦 “Track how much stock is left and at what price.”
What it does:
•	During product entry, seller can say or type:
o	“Quantity: 10 packs”
o	“Price: ₹120 per item”
•	Stored in Supabase DB along with timestamp.
Why it’s useful:

🔹 8. Reminders & Smart Notifications
🔔 “Get alerts when products are outdated or running low.”

o	“Stock of Handmade Soap is below 5.”
•	Adds a red warning tag in dashboard UI.
Why it’s useful:
Many small sellers forget to update products. This helps them stay active and relevant in the digital catalog.
